# Challenge-One
Our first in class challenge was to make the code we recived accessible to E-Readers and people with disabilites.

# Geting Started
So first I saw that there were alot of div tags. The reason that is bad is because if someone with a disability where to access that page they wouldnt be able to navigate the webpage. So I replaces them with the correct semantic text. Therefor being that everyone would be able to access the webpage.

# Code
So what i replaced the div's with were. Header, Section, Footer. So that made it an accessible web page. Also found that there was some missing code that would direct to user to a certin section on the webpage so I went in and added that so it would take the user to the correct area on the webpage.
