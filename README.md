# Challenge-One
    Our first in class challenge was to make the code we recived accessible to E-Readers and people with disabilites.

# Geting Started
    SO first I saw that there were alot of div tags. The reason that is bad is because if someone with a disabilite where to access that page they wouldnt be able to navigate the webpage. So I replaces them with the correct semantic text.

# Code
So what i replaced the div's with were. Header, Section, Footer. So that made it an accessible web page.
